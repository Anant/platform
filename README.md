Anant's list of saas, paas, dbaas, iaas, xaas, whatever as a service that helps us build business platforms.Maintained by Rahul Singh of [Anant](http://anant.us). I've borrowed the general outline of the different types of platforms from a Gartner PDF on Building Digital Business Technology Platforms but the rest is curated by our team. Feel free contact me if you'd like to collaborate on this and other awesome lists.
